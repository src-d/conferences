**Abstract**:

Typos correction substitutes a big part of the code review process, and it can and should be
automated. I present Typos Corrector - a tool for automatic correction of typos in source code 
identifiers in pull requests. It is powered by AI and source{d} Lookout - open source framework 
for assisted code review, that allows creating and running personal source code analyzers.
Typos Corrector encompasses the knowledge obtained from 60 million identifiers present in the 
world's open source code. It adjusts to each repository to leverage the local naming conventions. 
Typos Corrector achieves 93% accuracy of corrections on our dataset.
The talk will focus on the Typos Corrector's architecture, details of its pure Python
implementation and problems which I hit with applying ML to the real-world problems.

**Notes**:

This is my first talk and conference that I visit, so I desperately need guidence.
